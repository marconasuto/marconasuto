## Projects

[deepAmazon](https://github.com/marconasuto/deepamazon)
A project on using deep learning and satellite images to help tracking and planning a sustainable strategy for a region. Geospatial analysis on fires and commodities production sites in the Amazon using satellite VIIR and RAISG data. Implemented using Keras and lower level Tensorflow.

[atlasEuropa](https://github.com/marconasuto/atlasEuropa)
A project on using deep learning to map land cover and land use in Europe. Implemented specific architecture SpectrumNet from a paper from scratch, to leverage on multi-spectral images. Used transfer learning for raster images. Developed map in Folium as proof of concept of possible final product as atlas. Topic: Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Sentinel-2 images for multi-class classification, trained to track Land cover - Land use over 34 European countries.

[Coral](https://github.com/marconasuto/coral)
Telco customer churn analysis and prediction.
Churn users profiles: cluster analysis using K-means algorithm, visualisation in Tableau.
Classification models and customers churning risk segmentation
Potential profits and ROI targeting customers at high/very high risk of churning

[Realestimate](https://github.com/marconasuto/realestimate)
A data-driven, real estate tool and a multilinear regression with geospatial analysis to: 1) Predicting housing prices in King County, WA; 2) Housing pricing inference; 3) Test an MVP with performance close to Zillow's off-market estimates.

[Action!](https://github.com/marconasuto/films-EDA-project-mod-1)
What are the best films to be produced by Return-On-Investment and profits? An exploratory data analysis on film production in the last 5 years, from 2014 to 2019, using scraped data from imdbPro.
